# githubreviews-testrepo

Test repository for the GitHub Reviews project.

## Overview

This repository serves as a testing ground for implementing a review tool that allows users to review content directly on deployed GitHub Pages, with reviews stored in GitHub issues or pull requests.

## GitHub Pages

The test site is available at GitHub Pages (once enabled in repository settings):
- **Main Page**: [docs/index.html](docs/index.html)
- **Page 1**: [docs/page1.html](docs/page1.html) - Sample Documentation
- **Page 2**: [docs/page2.html](docs/page2.html) - Example Content

## Purpose

This repository contains multiple pages with different types of content to help validate the review functionality:
- A main index page that links to other pages
- Additional pages with sample documentation and content
- Various HTML elements and structures to test the review tool

## Future Plans

- Integrate the review tool functionality
- Generate HTML from code
- Add more complex sample pages
- Test different content types and layouts

## Setup

To enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose the branch (e.g., `main` or your working branch)
5. Select `/docs` as the folder
6. Save the settings

The site will be deployed and accessible at the GitHub Pages URL.
